                         for more information about how we structured our model interfaces and
                         classes.


CONTROLLER DESIGN:
  - WorksheetController: represents the interface for a controller that
                         controls a worksheet implementation.
  - WorksheetGUIController: represents an implementation of a WorksheetController and by default,
                            it creates an editable implementation of a worksheet view.
                            In addition to implementing the WorksheetController, it also implements
                            FeaturesListener interface which holds all of the commands that a user
                            would do when manipulating the GUI interface.

  - FeaturesListener: represents what commands to callback when the user interacts with the program.
                      It is responsible for interacting with the view and making the necessary
                      updates so that the user gets some kind of feedback after their interaction.

VIEW DESIGN:
  - WorksheetView: represents the interface for any kind of view implementation of the Worksheet. It
                    contains the methods that the view would need to render and refresh its view for
                    the user.
  - WorksheetTextualView: represents a textual implementation of a Worksheet. As values are read in
                          from a file, the coordinate followed by its value is printed on its own
                          line.
  - WorksheetEditableView: represents an editable version of a worksheet where a user is able
                            to interact with the program and make changes as they wish. It contains
                            a worksheet panel which acts as a container for -just- the grid portion
                            of the view. It also creates additional JPanels to handle the formula
                            bar positioned at the top of the grame.
  - WorksheetVisualView: represents a read-only interface of the worksheet where the user is able to
                         view the values from a text file that has been read in, but is not able to
                         make any changes on the interface, nor are they allowed to save their work.
  - WorksheetPanel: main container panel for -just- the grid of cells. It creates the row and header
                    panels as well. In addition, there is a panel at the bottom of the frame
                    to navigate / scroll through the worksheet.
  - WorksheetCell: It was getting too messy to have JTextField[][] everywhere so we abstracted this
                  textfield out onto its own class. It represents a singular cell in the textfield
                  grid.
