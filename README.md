Goal of HWK8: make our spreadsheet application work with the editable view we were provided from our Provider group.


    Todo List:
        * Implement getMaxCoord() and getSheet() in WorksheetAdapter class
        * Get ProviderController to work
        * Finish code critique
        * Review of our experience with this assignment
        * Create a README explaining which files you changed for your customers, and why the changes were needed.
        * Compile zip of the final version of files you set your customers
        * Create a README summarizing which features you were able to get working successfully and which features do not work in your final submission
        * JAR file working with -provider
