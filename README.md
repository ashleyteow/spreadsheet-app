## Spreadsheet Application (Java)
### By Ashley Teow and Gauri Dandi

Spreadsheet-like application that accomodates basic spreadsheet functions like SUM, CONCAT, SUBTRACT. The model contains rules and 'state' of any given spreadsheet. The controller handles user interaction, like clicking on a cell or arrowing into the next cell, executing formulas `=SUM(1+2)`. The view is built using JPanel and JFrames with individual panels for the headers, the rows and the cells.
